# Car Park Management System

## What is this
This is a car park management system created as a part of my university assignment. It is written in Java (obviously) in Netbeans.

## Project requirements
The requirements of the system are

1.	A menu system should be available to select either record mode or admin mode;
2.	VRN (Vehicle Registration Numbers) are to be entered manually via the user interface. In record mode, the system is to check the database to determine whether the vehicle is already in the car park. If it is not, the car is to be recorded as having entered along with the timestamp of the entry. If the vehicle is in the car park, then it is to be recorded as having exited, along with the timestamp.
3.	The database is to be saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) file, recording the VRN, entry date and time, and exit date and time.
4.	All records can be displayed, amended or deleted.

System Inputs & Functionality

1.	In the Admin function 

    a.	the operator should be able to display a list of vehicles currently in the car park, and

    b.	search the complete database for a VRN, to display all historic entries for that vehicle;

    c.	amend any historic record to correct errors;

    d.	remove any incorrect records.

All project requirements were met.
